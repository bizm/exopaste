# exopaste

*Exopaste* is a simple pastebin-like service written in the [Clojure programming language](https://clojure.org/), and whose purpose is mainly to demonstrate how [Exoscale](https://www.exoscale.com) writes high performance Clojure applications.

This project is the companion project for the series of *exopaste* articles published on our [Syslog blog](https://www.exoscale.com/syslog/).

## Running this project

Git tags are used to track the evolution of the project over several articles.

```
